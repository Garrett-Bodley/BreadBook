> As an avid sourdough baker, I created BreadBook in hopes of providing an online community where bakers could log their own baking process and share their various techniques, ingredients, and recipes with one another. Both ingredients and recipes are public, with users able to like, comment, and bookmark those they find interesting. Further discussion is possible in the Forum, where users can post about one of their recent bakes or comment on the posts of others.
